# A Sample Dev Container

This will work with GitHub codespaces (either in browser or via your local VSCode - requires a VSCode extension).

This uses [the sample Python devcontainer](https://github.com/devcontainers/images/tree/main/src/python) as inspiration. Lots more sample environments [here](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src).

Also interesting (but untested) is https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod which promises to read this file but spin up on local machines / any cloud.
